# Replication Code for ["Thinking *SMART*er about election fraud in Rockland County, NY"](https://christophertkenny.com/posts/2025-06-17-rockland-sare/)

To run the replication, simply run the files in the R folder in numerical order.
All public data necessary is included in the `data-raw` folder, with the exception of:

1. A copy of the NY voter file, as I cannot legally distribute this
2. A listing of the names and election districts for individuals who filed affidavits. These are technically public, but they are ordinary voters, not politicians. This can be recreated by reading the filings on [NYS CEF](https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/DocumentList?docketId=8m9vd/TuVGcRxztbi5BQMw==&display=all&courtType=Rockland%20County%20Supreme%20Court&resultsPageNum=1).
